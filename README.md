**`Experienced Programmer/Amateur Game Dev`**

As a third-year Computer Science major at McMaster University, I'm fueled by my enduring curiosity about various aspects of the field. I'm always on the lookout for new tools to add to my programming arsenal, driven by a passion for continuous learning and growth. Every coding project I've taken upon is crafted from the ground up, starting with comprehensive planning and design, and culminating into an application that either solves real-life problems or simulates them with code.
